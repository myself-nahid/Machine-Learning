# Linear Regression
## Description
Linear regression is a type of supervised machine learning algorithm that computes the linear relationship between the dependent variable and one or more independent features by fitting a linear equation to observed data.

Y = wX + b

Y --> Dependent Variable

X --> Independent Variable

w --> weight

b --> bias

## Gradient Descent

Gradient Descent is an optimization algorithm used for minimizing the loss function in various machine learning algorithms. It is used for updating the parameters of the learning model.

w = w - α*dw

b = b - α*db

## Learning Rate

Learning rate is a tuning parameter in an optimization algorithm that determines the step size at each iteration while moving toward a minimum of a loss function.
